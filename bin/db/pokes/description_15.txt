69 Even though its body is extremely skinny, it is blindingly fast when catching its prey.
70 Even though it is filled with acid, it does not melt because it also oozes a protective fluid.

85 It collects data and plans three times as wisely, but it may think too much and fall into a state of immobility.
86 Although it can’t walk well on land, it is a graceful swimmer. It especially loves being in frigid seas.
87 Its streamlined body has little drag in water. The colder the temperature, the friskier it gets.
88 As it moves, it loses bits of its body, from which new GRIMER emerge. This worsens the stench around it.
89 They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse.

98 If it senses danger approaching, it cloaks itself with bubbles from its mouth so it will look bigger.

109 Its thin, filmy body is filled with gases that cause constant sniffles, coughs and teary eyes.
110 If one of the twin KOFFING inflates, the other one deflates. It constantly mixes its poisonous gases.
111 It is inept at turning because of its four short legs. It can only charge and run in one direction.
112 Its rugged hide protects it from even the heat of lava. However, the hide also makes it insensitive.

122 A skilled mime from birth, it gains the ability to create invisible objects as it matures.
123 It slashes through grass with its sharp scythes, moving too fast for the human eye to track.
124 It rocks its body rhythmically. It appears to alter the rhythm depending on how it is feeling.
