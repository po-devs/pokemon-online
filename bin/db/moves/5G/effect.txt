227 Effect lasts for four to eight rounds, including the current round. During effect, opponent, during each of its turns, uses the last move it used before this attack was used, with no target, and opponent chooses that move for use automatically and can't choose any other move for use.

This attack fails if there is no affected move; the affected move is Transform, Mimic, Sketch, Mirror Move, Encore, or Struggle; if opponent doesn't have affected move; or if affected move has zero PP. During effect, this attack fails against opponent. Effect ends when opponent is replaced. At the beginning of opponent's turn and at the end of the round, if affected move has changed, effect ends. At the end of the round, if affected move has zero PP, effect ends.
228 When opponent switches, if user chose this move for use and opponent is one of user's opposing Pokémon, and if user is not asleep, frozen, or about to skip its attack this round because it has Truant, and if user did not take its turn yet this round, user uses this attack with effectiveness doubled and skips its attack this round.
