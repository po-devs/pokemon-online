Effect ends without causing confusion if this attack's type is ineffective against opponent's types [before the last round of the effect], if user is prevented from using this attack, or when user falls asleep, becomes frozen, or is replaced [before the last round of the effect].

This attack's power is multiplied by 2 to the power of X. If user is asleep, this attack's effect lasts one turn.

219 {For five rounds, including the current round, for each active Pokémon on the user's side, attacks by other Pokémon and items cannot inflict status problems or confusion against that Pokémon. During effect, Yawn will fail against any active Pokémon on the user's side. During effect, this attack fails for user's party.}
220 User's HP and opponent's HP become equal to the average of user's and opponent's current HP, rounded down, and are adjusted so that they don't exceed their total HP. Not affected by type immunities.
221 May burn opponent. (50%) If user is frozen and it chose this move for use, it becomes defrosted before this attack is used.
222 This attack's power is 10 (5% chance), 30 (10%), 50 (20%), 70 (30%), 90 (20%), 110 (10%), or 150 (5%) (Magnitude 4 through 10, respectively). If an opponent is using Dig, this attack's power is doubled for that opponent.

226 Replaces user's Pokémon with a different non-active Pokémon in user's party of user's choice and transfers user's stat stages, confusion, and effects of certain moves to the new Pokémon.
227 Effect lasts for three rounds, including the current round. During effect, opponent, during each of its turns, uses the last move it used before this attack was used, with no target, and opponent chooses that move for use automatically and can't choose any other move for use. (Opponent can switch or flee as normal.) This attack fails if there is no affected move; the affected move is Transform, Mimic, Sketch, Mirror Move, Encore, or Struggle; if opponent doesn't have affected move; or if affected move has zero PP. During effect, this attack fails against opponent. Effect ends when opponent is replaced. At the beginning of opponent's turn and at the end of the round, if affected move has changed, effect ends. At the end of the round, if affected move has zero PP, effect ends.
228 When opponent switches, if user chose this move for use and opponent is one of user's opposing Pokémon, and if user is not asleep, frozen, or about to skip its attack this round because it has Truant, and if user did not take its turn yet this round, user uses this attack with effectiveness doubled and skips its attack this round. (Can be used this way even if disabled. If this attack is used this way, user is considered to strike before other Pokémon. If this attack causes the opponent to faint this way, the new Pokémon at opponent's position becomes active immediately.)
229 If this attack is successful, effects of multi-turn attacks and Leech Seed end for user, and effect of Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes ends for user's side.

248 {On the turn it is used, queues the attack; at the end of the round that follows the next round, if there is a Pokémon at opponent's position, that Pokémon is hit by the attack, damage is calculated with its Special Defense and the user's Special Attack. Accuracy check and damage weighting are performed when attack is returned, so stat boosts from moves, items and abilities only remain if the user stays in the field.

251 {Performs one hit for each unfainted Pokémon in user's party, excluding eggs and those with status problems, in party order. The Base Power of each hit is equal to int(Base Attack of the called Pokémon / 10) + 5; for this calculation, the Attack Stage of the called Pokémon is ignored, but held items that boost its Attack are not.

(That amount is also reset to 0.)
256 User gains HP according to the user's Stockpile count:  1/4 of total HP if it's 1; half of total HP if it's 2; and all HP if it's 3. Even if user's HP is full, resets user's Stockpile count to 0 and decreases user's Defense and Special Defense by the amount the user gained with Stockpile. (That amount is also reset to 0.)
