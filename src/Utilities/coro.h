/*
 * This library consists of only three files
 * coro.h, coro.c and LICENSE (and optionally README)
 *
 * It implements what is known as coroutines, in a hopefully
 * portable way. At the moment you have to define which kind
 * of implementation flavour you want:
 *
 * -DCORO_UCONTEXT
 *
 *    This flavour uses SUSv2's get/set/swap/makecontext functions that
 *    unfortunately only newer unices support.
 *
 * -DCORO_SJLJ
 *
 *    This flavour uses SUSv2's setjmp/longjmp and sigaltstack functions to
 *    do it's job. Coroutine creation is much slower than UCONTEXT, but
 *    context switching is often a bit cheaper. It should work on almost
 *    all unices.
 *
 * -DCORO_LINUX
 *
 *    Old GNU/Linux systems (<= glibc-2.1) only work with this implementation
 *    (it is very fast and therefore recommended over other methods, but
 *    doesn't work with anything newer).
 *
 * -DCORO_LOSER
 *
 *    Microsoft's highly proprietary platform doesn't support sigaltstack, and
 *    this automatically selects a suitable workaround for this platform.
 *    (untested)
 *
 * -DCORO_IRIX
 *
 *    SGI's version of Microsoft's NT ;)
 *
 * -DCORO_ASM
 *
 *    Handcoded assembly, known to work only on a few architectures/ABI:
 *    GCC + x86/IA32 and amd64/x86_64 + GNU/Linux and a few BSDs.
 *
 * -DCORO_PTHREAD
 *
 *    Use the pthread API. You have to provide <pthread.h> and -lpthread.
 *    This is likely the slowest backend, and it also does not support fork(),
 *    so avoid it at all costs.
 *
 * If you define neither of these symbols, coro.h will try to autodetect
 * the model. This currently works for CORO_LOSER only. For the other
 * alternatives you should check (e.g. using autoconf) and define the
 * following symbols: HAVE_UCONTEXT_H / HAVE_SETJMP_H / HAVE_SIGALTSTACK.

 *
 * As a special case, if coro, arg, sptr and ssize are all zero,
 * then an "empty" coro_context will be created that is suitable
 * as an initial source for coro_transfer.
 *
